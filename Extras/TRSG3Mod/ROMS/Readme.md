# G3Mod and G3JPMod Character ROM Substitute Board ROM Images

ROM images for use with the two ROM substitute boards. More images to follow. We still need to find a Kana character set!

## TRS80I_Short1_2k.bin

2KB image suitable for the TRS-80 Model I with shortened decenders to fit the character matrix.

## Gendon3_2k.bin

2KB image perceived as the primary image of the original Gendon3. This has long decenders that don't quite fit the TRS-80 Model I matrix size.

## TRS80IShort_Gendon3_4k.bin

4KB image for testing the image selection function with a 2532 EPROM. First half is TRS80I_Short1_2k.bin, second half Gendon3_2k.bin. Better images to follow.
